# Buddy Docs

A minimalistic document editor, which anyone can use. For the Buddy ecosystem, and is meant for students. Currently in beta.

*"The school Chromebook can't even handle Google Docs."* - me

Also another place for me to test my coding.

## Features

- **Basic things**
- **Material Design 3**: I'm using Material Design 3 for this project, for now, making the components are difficult.
- **Integration with CompactB**: Get summerizations, plan stuff, and chat. (Coming soon)

## Languages used

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm not gonna learn React for this.

## Info for users

Heya, this web app WILL take time to make, you can try it out, but I don't recommend switching to it. :D

## Info for programmers/coders/whatever (or people who want to Contribute)

If there's a "dev" branch, write in that instead of "main".

I typically use "main" as the GitHub Pages, and "dev" for actual coding. I will fix my naming soon okay? Thanks-
